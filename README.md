PlaySheet
=========

PlaySheet (for lack of a better project name) is a media player
for Windows built using F# and WPF.

It uses [MPV](https://mpv.io/) for rendering, and builds its
UI on top of it. It is designed to be minimal, and easy to extend.

**Development on PlaySheet has been indeterminately paused, as
I have started to work on other things. Should anyone want to
contribute or start their own fork, they should send me a message
or file an issue so that I can explain the structure of the repository
better.**
